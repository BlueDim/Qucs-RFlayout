.SH NAME
Qucs-RFlayout \- A tool to produce layout from RF schematics.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucsrflayout
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you will be
able to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and
simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the
circuit.  After that simulation has finished you will be able to
present the simulation results on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucs-RFlayout\fR is a tool for exporting your \fBQucs\fR RF schematics to a layout
editor such as \fBPcbNew\fR (\fBKiCad\fR) or \fBpcb-rnd\fR. It also allows generating
\fBopenEMS\fR scripts to perform more complex simulations (FDTD).
You can use either text mode or graphical mode. Graphical mode features
a preview of the generated layout.

Available topologies are: Microstrip only.
Coplanar and microstrip lange coupler are not supported.

Equations and variables in component values are not supported.
